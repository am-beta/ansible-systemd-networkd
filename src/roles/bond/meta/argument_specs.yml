    short_description: Manages systemd-networkd bonded network devices.
    description: |
      This role will create (or update) a number of items in /etc/systemd/network for
      each specified bonded device:
      1) A .netdev file for the bond device
      2) .network files for each link that is a member of the bond; files will be named
      with the bond device's name and a numeric suffix
      3) .link files for each interface that is a member of the bond; files will be named
      with the bond device's name and a numeric suffix

      On Debian and Debian-derivative systems the .link files are
      copied into the initramfs by the `update-initramfs` tool, which
      means that the system must be rebooted for changes in those
      files to take effect. In this situation the role will set a fact
      named 'systemd_networkd_link_reboot_required' and the system
      should be rebooted before any additional configuration of the
      bonded network links is attempted.

      Detailed descriptions of parameters and their behavior can be found in 'man systemd.netdev'
      and 'man systemd.link'.
