        This role operates in one of two modes:
        1) When "drop_in_for" is not specified, creates a .network file in /etc/systemd/network
        using the supplied "name", and applies the configuration provided to that file.
        2) When "drop_in_for" is specified, creates a .conf file in the drop-in directory for the
        network specified, using the supplied "name", and applies the configuration provided to
        that file.

        Detailed descriptions of parameters and their behavior can be found in 'man systemd.network'.
