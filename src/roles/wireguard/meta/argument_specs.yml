    short_description: Manages systemd-networkd WireGuard tunnel virtual network devices.
    description: |
      This role will create (or update) three items in /etc/systemd/network for
      each specified tunnel:
      1) A drop-in directory for the underlying network
      2) A .netdev file for the tunnel device
      3) A .conf file in the drop-in directory connecting the tunnel device
      to the underlying network

      Detailed descriptions of parameters and their behavior can be
      found in 'man systemd.netdev'.

      Sets fact named 'systemd_networkd_wireguard_changed' to
      either true or false to indicate whether any changes were made.
