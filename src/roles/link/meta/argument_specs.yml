    short_description: Manages systemd-networkd links.
    description: |
      This role will create (or update) one item in /etc/systemd/network for
      each specified link: a .link file for the link.

      On Debian and Debian-derivative systems the .link files are
      copied into the initramfs by the `update-initramfs` tool, which
      means that the system must be rebooted for changes in those
      files to take effect. In this situation the role will set a fact
      named 'systemd_networkd_link_reboot_required' and the system
      should be rebooted before any additional configuration of the
      links is attempted.

      Detailed descriptions of parameters and their behavior can be found in 'man systemd.link'.
